# Navigest-Testing
Navigest-testing is a gesture recognition program I developed using open source api to use in the usability testing for the project Navigest. 

Ichose Mediapipe for gesture tracking, which can predict blind spots when the hand is in the blind area. I also used open source software built by Python and OpenCV framework to calculate the relative position and angle of fingers to verify the captured gestures.

Please check on my online portfolio to see further details of the project:
